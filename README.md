bbPress Messages - User Private Messages with notifications, widgets and media with no BuddyPress needed.

Send and receive private messages from bbPress users on the forums easily. Embeds are detected atomatically from message text such as YouTube videos so no need for formatting the message text and also can parse shortcodes as well..

This is a lite free version, so many features were stripped out of it, the most of them consist of user blocking and unblocking, conversation archives, making messages unread, and much more nice widgets.

There are so many other cool features in the PRO pack which will be released in a week or so exclusively on CodeCanyon and can be found in <a href="//codecanyon.net/user/samiel/portfolio?ref=samiel">my portfolio page</a>.

This is the first week of release so bare in mind that there will be updates from time to time..
